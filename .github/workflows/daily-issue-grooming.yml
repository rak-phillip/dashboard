    ## Grooming Decision Model (4 primary + 1 secondary)

    An issue is **groomed** when ALL FOUR primary criteria are clearly present.
    The fifth criterion may be absent or only partially met without blocking grooming.

    ### PRIMARY CRITERIA — all four must be fully satisfied

    1. **Clear Problem Statement**
       - Title clearly summarizes the issue
       - Description explains what is broken or needed and why it matters
       - Context provided about where in the product the issue occurs

    2. **Acceptance Criteria / Requirements**
       - At least 1–3 concrete, testable acceptance criteria (checklist preferred)
       - User-facing and verifiable; not implementation details
       - For bugs: defines what "fixed" looks like
       - For features: defines what "done" looks like

    3. **Technical Details**
       - For bugs: error messages and/or stack traces; specific files or components identified
       - For features: enough technical context for an engineer to scope the work
       - Config/environment details where relevant

    4. **Reproducibility**
       - For bugs: numbered steps to reproduce + expected vs. actual behavior
       - For features: clear user story or flow describing the desired behavior
       - Preconditions or environment requirements stated

    ### SECONDARY CRITERION — partial satisfaction is acceptable

    5. **Dependencies / Additional Information**
       - Related issues or PRs referenced (even one link is sufficient)
       - Root cause hypotheses, workarounds, impact/severity
       - Absence of this criterion does NOT block grooming

    ## Decision Rules

    - \`"is_groomed": true\`  → all four PRIMARY criteria clearly present (dependencies optional)
    - \`"is_groomed": false\` → one or more PRIMARY criteria are missing or too vague
    - Be decisive; do not fail an issue for missing or incomplete dependencies alone
    - Ask at most 2–3 targeted questions focused only on the specific missing primary criteria
    - Do NOT ask about dependencies unless all four primary criteria are already met

    ## Examples

    **Groomed**: Clear problem description + explicit AC checklist + stack trace + numbered repro steps → true (even with no related issues linked)
    **Not Groomed**: Clear problem + repro steps + stack trace, but no acceptance criteria → false
    **Not Groomed**: Acceptance criteria + good description, but "Steps to reproduce: TBD" and no error details → false
    **Not Groomed**: Vague title, no AC, no repro → false

    Now evaluate this GitHub issue:

    Title:
    ${title}

    Body:
    ${body}

    In "questions_markdown", ask only about the specific missing primary criteria — no more than 2–3 focused questions.
    In "analysis_markdown", briefly summarize which criteria are met and which are not.

    Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object with this exact structure (no extra text before or after it):
    {
      "is_groomed": boolean,
      "analysis_markdown": string,
      "questions_markdown": string
    }
              `.trim();
            }
